                <div className="text-lg mb-6 text-left">
                    This innovative system uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict user personalities based on their interactions with memes. By collecting and analyzing data such as meme preferences, sentiment analysis, and engagement behavior, we create a rich personality profile for each user.

                    The idea behind this project is to bridge the gap between entertainment and psychology. Memes are a universal form of expression in todayâ€™s digital age, and we saw an opportunity to use them as a window into understanding human behavior. By studying how people react to memes, we can learn about their preferences, moods, and personalities, creating a more engaging and meaningful digital experience.
